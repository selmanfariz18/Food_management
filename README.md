# Food_management

## Problem:

    Food waste will be a major problem in the future, both environmentally and economically. Every year, millions of tons of food will be wasted, which will contribute to climate change and landfills.

## Solution:

    A web application will help people to reduce their food waste in the future. The application will provide users with tips on how to plan meals, store food properly, and use up leftovers. It will also allow users to connect with others in their community to share food that they are not going to eat.

## Implementation:

    The web application will be built using a modern web development framework, such as React or Vue.js, in the future. The backend will be implemented using a Node.js server or a Django server and a database to store the user data and the food waste reduction tips in the future.

### The web application will have the following features:

- Tips on how to plan meals, store food properly, and use up leftovers
- A community forum where users can share food that they are not going to eat

#### Goals:

- Reduce food waste
- get partnership with local businesses and organizations to promote this web app and reduce their food waste production

#### Motivations:

- Reduce the environmental impact of food waste
- Help people to eat healthier and more sustainably
- Build a community of people who are committed to reducing food waste
